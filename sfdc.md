# Salesforce - Trusted AI 

We believe the benefits of AI should be accessible to everyone. But it is not enough to deliver only the technological capabilities of AI â€“ we also have an important responsibility to ensure that AI is safe and inclusive for all. We take that responsibility seriously and are committed to providing our employees, customers, and partners with the tools they need to develop and use AI safely, accurately, and ethically.


## Responsible
To safeguard human rights and protect the data we are entrusted with, we work with human rights experts, and educate, empower and share our research with customers and partners.


## Inclusive
AI should respect the values of all those impacted, not just those of its creators. To achieve this, we test models with diverse data sets, seek to understand their impact, and build inclusive teams.


## Accountable
To create AI accountability we seek stakeholders feedback, take guidance from the Ethical Use Advisory Council, and conduct our own data science review board.


## Transparent
We strive for model explainability and clear usage terms, and ensure customers control their own data & models.


## Empowering
Accessible AI promotes growth and increased employment, and benefits society as a whole.
