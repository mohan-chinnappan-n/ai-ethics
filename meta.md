Through regular collaboration with subject matter experts, policy stakeholders and people with lived experiences, we’re continuously building and testing approaches to help ensure our machine learning (ML) systems are designed and used responsibly.


## Privacy and security
Protecting the privacy and security of people’s data is the responsibility of everyone at Meta AI.

Everyone should be treated fairly when using our products and they should work equally well for all people.

## Robustness and safety
AI systems should meet high performance standards, and should be tested to ensure they behave safely and as intended.

People who use our products should have more transparency and control around how data about them is **collected and used**.

We build reliable processes to ensure accountability for our AI systems and the decisions they make.
